# 🖼️ Serverless Gen-AI Image Generator using AWS

This project is a fully serverless application that generates AI-powered images based on text prompts using Amazon Bedrock's Stable Diffusion model.

## 🧰 Key AWS Services Used
🔹 Amazon Bedrock – Text-to-image generation using GenAI (Stable Diffusion)
🔹 AWS Lambda – Orchestration with fully serverless compute
🔹 Amazon S3 – Scalable object storage with secure delivery via presigned URLs
🔹 Amazon DynamoDB – Logging and tracking of prompts and statuses
🔹 IAM Roles & Policies – Secure service-to-service communication

## 🔁 Workflow

1. User sends a prompt to the API Gateway → Lambda.
2. Lambda calls Bedrock to generate an image.
3. Image (base64) is decoded and uploaded to S3.
4. A presigned URL is returned to the user.
5. Prompt and status are logged in DynamoDB.

## 💵 Cost Estimate (10 Requests)

> Estimated cost: **~$0.22 for 10 image generations** using Bedrock, Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB (excluding free tier).

## ✅ Example Event Payload

```json
{
  "prompt": "A futuristic city skyline at night"
}
```

###  Real-World Use Cases
